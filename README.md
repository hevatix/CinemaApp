Application developed in JavaFx, connection to a MySQL server

  This app was created for a school project.
  
  The purpose of the developement was to create an application capable of displaying the basic information
of a Theater, such as the current billboard, the movie schedule for different locations, also an option
for consulting the movies that are coming soon to the screen. Finally a comment section, in wich users can
post their thougts about the app, or give feedback to the company.

  To make this application work you will need to setup a MySQL database server, wich will store all the
information about the movies, schedules or file locations for the media resources (images and trailers).
You will also need a web server that will be were all the media will be stored.
